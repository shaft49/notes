- Modular
- Reusable

## OOD Design Principles

### SOLID Design Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainabl.

- S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - A class should do a single task.
- O: Open Closed Design Principles (OCP)
- L: Liskov Substitution Principles (LSP)
- I: Interface Segregation Principles (ISP)
- D: Dependency Inversion (DI)
  - High Level modules should not depend on the low level modules.

## Design Patterns

- A general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

### Factory Design Principle

- Simple Factory
- Factory Method
- Abstract

### Facade Method

- Hide to complexity of code

### Flyweight Design Pattern

- Used to save memory
- If you want to use multiple class of same type then reuse the memory address of the first created class. Assuming the objects will be immutable. To me, similar to singleton pattern but for multiple objects.

### Composite Pattern

## How to attempt LLD questions in interview?

- Step 1: Clarify Requirements/Handle Ambiguity
- Step 2: Define the Core Objects / Class Diagram
- Step 3: Analyze Relationship
- Step 4: Investigate Actions, Apply Design Patterns
- Step 5: Write codes to a specific class that your interviewer asked.

> Express your assumptions to the interviewer.
