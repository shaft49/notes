# Intro to Data Science

## What is Data Science?

- Turning data into information.
- Analyze data to get insights about data.
- Identify trends, patterns, corelation from data
- Contextualizing [provides context to an event, person, or item], Applying and Understanding them

## What does a Data Scientist do?

- Get and process data to convert it from its raw format to a cleaner format.
- Suggest application from the information
- Develop Machine Learning Implementations

## Essentials of DataScience

### Statistics

- Understanding the different types of data
  - Numerical: Quantitive Data (car speed)
  - Categorical: Qualititive Data (gender of a person)
  - Ordinal: Mixing of Numerical and Categorical (Hotel Ratings)
- Understanding key statistical terms
  - Types of means
  - Fluctuations in data
- Types of Averages
  - Mean: Sum of all values divided by no of values
  - Median: Middle value in the dataset
  - Mode: Most Common Value in data
- Splitting up, grouping and segmenting data points.

#### Spread of Data

##### Range + Domain

- Range: Difference between the maxium and minimum value of your data.
- Domain: The values that your data points can take on.

##### Variance + Standard Deviation

- Variance: How much the values in the data differe from the mean value.
- STD: Square root of variance.

##### Covariance + Corelation

- Covariance: Measures between two different variables. How much on variable changes when the other one changes.
- Corelation: Covariance divided by the std of each variable. It is done so that the data fits better for all the variables.
  - Corelation of 1 : Positive corelation. If one goes up, another one will also go up. More coffee, more happy,
  - Corelation of 0: No corelation. coffee and weather.
  - Corelation of -1: Negative corelation. If one goes up, another one will go down. More coffee, less tired.
  - If there's a corelation between two variables, that doesn't mean one is caused by the other.

### Data Visualization

- Graphs for showing the data

### Programming

- Not all data scientist knows how to code, but it is important.
