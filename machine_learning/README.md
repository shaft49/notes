# Machine Learning
- [ML Study Plan](https://github.com/python-engineer/ml-study-plan)
Machine learning is the practice of using algorithms to analyze data, learn from that data, and then make a determination or prediction about new data.

With machine learning, rather than manually writing code with a specific set of instructions to accomplish a specific task, the machine is trained using data and algorithms that give it the ability to perform the task without being explicitly being told how to do so.

# Deep Learning
Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain's neural networks.

## What Does Deep Mean In Deep Learning?
Deep learning uses ANNs that have multiple hidden layers. If an ANN has more than one hidden layer, the ANN is said to be a deep ANN.

# Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial Neural Networks are computing system that are inspired by the brain's neural network.
 
* Each connection between neurons can transmit a signal from one neuron to another.
* The receiving neuron processes the signal and passes it to the neurons connected to it.
* Neurons are organized in layers
    * Input Layer : First Layer
    * Hidden Layer : Any layer except input & output
    * Output Layer: Last Layer
