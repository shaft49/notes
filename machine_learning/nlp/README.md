## NLP Techniques

### Bag of Words

Convert a sentence into 1D vector where 1 means certain word is present, 0 means absent in the sentence.

### Tokenization

Splitting a sentence into meaningful units(words, punctuation characters, numbers)

- What would you do with 100\$?
- [`What` `would` `you` `do` `with` `100` `$` `?`]

### Stemming

Generate the root form of the word. Crude heuristic that chops off the ends of word.

- Organize Organizes Organizing
- Organ Organ Organ
