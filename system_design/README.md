# System Design

## The Plan

### 1.

- [x] [Jackson Gabbard Intro to Architecture and System Design Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgdS0EUmn70)
  - Talks about what to expect in a system interview.
  - Don't have any specific correct answer for system design. Interviewer will not provide all the information. You need to break down the problem by asking questions.
  - Get start with the parts that you're more familiar with then move onto the remaining parts and describe your assumptions.
  - Don't get scared or intimidated about how crazy these problems sound. Turn the big crazy numbers into a reasonable numbers. Suppose there are 500m active users of an app but that doesn't mean all of them uses the app at the same time. Convert it into a rough numbers of concurrent users which might be 50k or less. 50k is preety reasoanble number.
  - Challenge of the interview is refine, refine and refine to go broad and dive deep .
  - Try to help the interviewer to help you. Keep yourself engaged.
  - If you're not in a company who builds system for millions of users then learn the details of architecture of those who does.
  - If you get rejected it means you were at least at the front door of that place. just keep going
